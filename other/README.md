# Tomasulo-Simulation
A Tomasulo Simulation GitHub repository contains code implementing the Tomasulo Algorithm, a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in superscalar processors for out-of-order execution of instructions. This simulation helps users understand and experiment with the workings of this algorithm in computer architecture.
